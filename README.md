# Token Launchpad

## Overview

Token Launchpad is a decentralized platform aimed at empowering creators and projects to launch their own tokens in a secure and accessible environment. Built on blockchain technology, this platform ensures transparency, user autonomy, and streamlined token creation and management.

## Features

- **Token Generation**: Create and launch custom tokens with configurable parameters.
- **Decentralized Transactions**: All transactions are securely recorded on the blockchain.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for both novice and experienced users.
- **Smart Contract Security**: Ensures safe interactions between users and contracts.
- **Transparency**: Full visibility of all transactions on the blockchain.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Ethereum, Hardhat
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Folder Structure

- `frontend/` - Contains the user interface code.
- `backend/` - Manages server-side logic.
- `contracts/` - Includes Solidity smart contracts for token management.
- `scripts/` - Scripts for deployment and testing of contracts.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Hardhat (for smart contract deployment)
- MetaMask (for interacting with the blockchain)
- Ethereum test network (such as Ropsten or Ganache)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lakshya2099/Token-Launchpad.git
   cd Token-Launchpad
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables** (such as API keys and network configuration) in a `.env` file.

## Usage

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Launch the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Deploy smart contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [network_name]
   ```

4. **Interact with MetaMask**: Connect MetaMask to the specified network and start using the platform.

## Future Scope

- Multi-chain support for launching tokens across various blockchains.
- Advanced token customization options, including staking and governance features.
- Integrate advanced analytics to monitor token performance and usage.
